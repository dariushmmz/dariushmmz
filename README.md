## ðŸ‘‹ Greetings and respect,  

Iâ€™m **Dariush**, a **Computer Engineering student** passionate about building intelligent systems that learn from data.  

I specialize in **Machine Learning** and **Image/Text Processing**, with over **3 years of experience** in diverse **Data Science projects**.  
My expertise covers:  

-  **Deep Neural Networks** â€” design, training, and optimization  
-  **Data Processing & Visualization** â€” transforming raw data into meaningful insights  
-  **Model Fine-Tuning** â€” improving pre-trained models for real-world performance  
-  **Computer Vision** â€” segmentation, detection, and generative modeling  
-  **Language Models (NLP)** â€” from text classification to transformer-based architectures  

Iâ€™m always open to collaboration on developing and improving **AI-driven solutions**, especially those based on **deep learning** and **language models**.
